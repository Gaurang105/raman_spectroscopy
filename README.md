# raman_spectroscopy
Source code to my 2016 Master's dissertation supplementary code: Developing Sustainable Materials (CZTS) for Thin-Film Solar Devices Using Raman and Photoluminescence Spectroscopy

The code here cleans, removes baselines, finds the peaks of Raman spectroscopic lineshapes and autonomously fit convolutional Lorentzian's to the spectra. This allows you to **systematically identify the composite molecular compounds** present within a material sample for hundreds of spectra instantaneously, **a task that typically takes many hours/ days of a skilled researcher's time**.

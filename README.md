# raman_spectroscopy
Source code to my 2017 Master's degree: Developing Sustainable Materials (CZTS) for Thin-Film Solar Devices Using Raman and Photoluminescence Spectroscopy

The code here cleans, removes baselines, finds the peaks of Raman spectroscopic lineshapes and autonomously fit convolutional Lorentzian's to the spectra.
